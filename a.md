Create an **index.html** file for a Chrome extension landing page. This webpage should include a description of the extension, its features, installation instructions, and a link to the privacy policy. The privacy policy should be on a separate page (**privacy-policy.html**) that opens when clicked. The website will be hosted on **GitHub Pages**, so ensure the privacy policy is linked properly.

#### **Page Structure**
1. **index.html (Main Page)**
   - **Header**:
     - Extension logo
     - Extension name
     - A tagline or brief description
     - Buttons: **"View on GitHub"**, **"Privacy Policy"**
   - **About Section**:
     - Briefly explain what the extension does
     - Outline its benefits and use cases
   - **Features Section**:
     - Display features in a visually appealing way (e.g., grid layout)
   - **Installation Instructions**:
     - Step-by-step guide for installing the extension manually
   - **Usage Instructions**:
     - How users can interact with the extension

   - **Footer**:
     - Copyright notice
     - Links to the privacy policy and GitHub repository

2. **privacy-policy.html (Privacy Policy Page)**
   - **Introduction**:
     - Explain what data is collected, how it is used, and why
   - **Data Collection & Usage**:
     - Describe what information the extension accesses (if any)
   - **Required Permissions**:
     - List and explain the Chrome extension permissions
   - **Third-Party Services**:
     - If external APIs are used, mention their data policies

   - **User Rights**:

The **index.html** file should be **styled using CSS** to ensure a **modern, user-friendly interface**. Use a **dark theme** with color variables for consistency. The privacy policy should be clearly linked on both pages.
The HTML should be **well-structured** and **semantic**, ensuring it is easy to read and maintain. Use **comments** to explain sections of the code.
The CSS should be **responsive** to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Use **flexbox** or **grid layout** for the features section to make it visually appealing.
