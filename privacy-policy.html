            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Read Aloud Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our extension. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your data.</p>
            <p>By installing and using the Read Aloud extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>The Read Aloud extension is designed to operate with minimal data collection. Here's what we do and don't collect:</p>

            <h3>What we collect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> We store your settings (reading speed, pitch, and preferred voice) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This information never leaves your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What we don't collect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content of Web Pages:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit the content of the web pages you visit or the text that is read aloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> We do not track which websites you visit.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any personally identifiable information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Required Permissions</h2>
            <p>The Read Aloud extension requires the following permissions to function properly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your preferences (speed, pitch, voice) between browser sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To access the content of the current tab for text-to-speech functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>contextMenus:</strong> To add the "Read from this text" option to your right-click menu.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the extension's core functionality and not for collecting or transmitting data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All user preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Text-to-Speech Processing</h2>
            <p>The Read Aloud extension uses your browser's built-in Speech Synthesis API to convert text to speech. This processing happens entirely on your device. No text is sent to external servers for processing.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Read Aloud extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.</p>
